# interview-task

## Task 1
data.txt contains " character on line 21 and 29 with cust_no C20 and C28.
As explained in 'data-as-html.py' and 'data-as-string.py', I assume that this data was entered incorrectly.
So I decided to delete " character in the beginning of the lines mentioned above so I can proceed with the task.

Please find bash script 'sort-and-update-date.sh' where data is sorted and date is modified. Datasource is 'data-bash.txt'. New file 'updated-data.txt' is generated.
