# interview-task

## Task 1
data.txt contains " character on line 21 and 29 with cust_no C20 and C28.
As explained in 'data-as-html.py' and 'data-as-string.py', I assume that this data was entered incorrectly.
So I decided to delete " character in the beginning of the lines mentioned above so I can proceed with the task.
